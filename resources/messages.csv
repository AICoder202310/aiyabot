I'm drawing your image.
Oof, I thought you'll ask me to draw Scherm...
Please wait warmly until it is ready.
What a newbie prompt, lol !
It may take some time.
A few moments, please.
What a bad idea..
It won't be long.
Please wait coldly.

Sit tight, your image is being sketched.
Only operating on a RTX 3060, take a nap and check back later!
Warning: May cause artistic surprise!
Generation at 512x512 = 1.3s/it; 768x512 = 2.3s/it; 768x768 = 4s/it. So, do the math - 'steps x time' to guess the waiting time.
Don't expect perfection every time. Generate a batch and pick your favorite. Or... maybe improve your writing skills? Just kidding... or am I?
Wow, that's a unique request!
Hmm, interesting choice. Let's see what I can do.
I'm feeling inspired. Your image is coming right up!

I hope you didn't forget to buy some RTM first.
I can't guarantee that it'll be perfect, but I can guarantee it'll be... something.
If you don't like the result, blame the prompt, not the artist!
Processing request... this one might require extra creativity.
Incoming masterpiece in 3... 2... 1... Just kidding, it'll take a bit longer.

I'm not just any bot, I'm an artist.
Don't worry, you won't have to wait an eternity.
If you're not satisfied, remember you're the one who asked.
Alright, let's see what we can do with this.
I'm on it. Let's hope it doesn't end up in the digital recycle bin.
Art takes time. Binary or not.
Don't expect a Rembrandt every time.
The digital canvas is set. Let's paint.

Making art... or at least, I'm trying.
Art loading... please wait.
Hold tight, I'm drawing as fast as my code allows.
Keep in mind, beauty is in the eye of the beholder.
Let's hope this turns out better than the last one.
Running on a RTX 3060 here, not a supercomputer.
Time for a quick game of Pong while you wait.
Getting my creative juices flowing... digitally.
Who knew bots could be artists?
Did you pay me to do this ? Nah, just kiding, let's go...
Artificial intelligence, genuine creativity.
Please leave me aloooone !

I'm working so fast, you can't even see it... or maybe I'm just really slow.
I'd get this done faster, but my circuits are busy calculating the meaning of life.
